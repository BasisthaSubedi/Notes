# Python Class and Objects: A Quick Overview

In Python, classes and objects are the foundations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Classes allow you to define new types, and objects are instances of those types. Understanding classes and objects is crucial for writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

## What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that are common to all objects of the class. Essentially, a class represents a template from which you can create multiple objects with similar characteristics and behaviors.

### Syntax for Defining a Class

```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        
    def method1(self):
        print("This is method1.")
        
    def method2(self):
        print("This is method2.")
```

### Key Concepts:
- **`__init__` method**: This is the constructor method, which is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the attributes of the class.
- **Attributes**: Variables that hold data related to an object.
- **Methods**: Functions that define behaviors related to an object.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class. It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class. Once an object is created, you can access its attributes and call its methods.

### Creating an Object

```python
# Create an object of the class
obj = ClassName(param1_value, param2_value)
```

In the above code, `obj` is an object of the class `ClassName`. The `__init__` method is invoked when the object is created, and it initializes the object with the values provided for `param1` and `param2`.

### Accessing Object Attributes and Methods

Once the object is created, you can access its attributes and methods using the dot notation.

```python
# Access attributes
print(obj.param1)

# Call methods
obj.method1()
```
